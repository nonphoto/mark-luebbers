**Principles of Chemistry** 

Was for me

shall we say 

difficult.

The less said the better

about my fumbled 

summer-school reach

to grasp how all 

that we can see

is made of 

all that we 

cannot. 

Strange then when 

I think of bonds today 

it all makes sense:

wandering ions 

fizzing in endless space

on the tips of our fingers

colliding 

then drawn

regardless of will or time

to a perfect valence

to exactly what one lacks

the demonstration 

of completeness

as practical

as made real 

not meant to be torn

asunder.
