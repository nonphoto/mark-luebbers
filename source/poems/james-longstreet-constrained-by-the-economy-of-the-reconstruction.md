**James Longstreet Constrained by the Economy of the Reconstruction**



During his years in New Orleans

Longstreet pursued several commercial ventures

including the sale of insurance

and membership in the city’s cotton brokerage,

either of which, before the war,

might have brought him a comfortable return.



But the General,

who had known command

in a different world,

was too blunt and naïve

for the scarce and subtle business of those

post-war days, found his means reduced,

and wrote letters seeking

accommodation of his debts.

His penury, of course, remained

both private and a matter of degree,

since he was a man of modest habits.



He was discomfited, then,

each of the several times

there was a knock on the broad door

and the servant revealed the caller

to be a veteran of his Corps:

one who had fought at Antietam perhaps,

or Fredericksburg, and now

was seated before the General

threadbare and gamey,

and bragging that he had

“just killed me a Yankee.”



Even settled deeply as he was

in the good chair’s horsehair cushions,

Longstreet recoiled as he recognized

the false boast to be coded beggary.



Still, he would find for the man

a bag of food from the pantry

and walk with him to the hall.

But after setting him out

with farewell and exhortation

the General would turn

inward with dismay

at the frailty of the renewed Union,

and apprehension

at the reckoning of his name.
