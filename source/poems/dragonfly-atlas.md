These words could be written in the border margin
of a map rendering the assembled counties of Ohio.
The page in the bare sun presented to the readerâ€™s eye
on the side of a county road wavering in the green heat.

The road ahead meandering and inscrutable, nameless,
as all roads to themselves are, bisecting farms and woodlots:
homes of creatures domestic and feral. The reader perhaps a
pilgrim, expatriate or lost, and as such, in hope of bearing.

This map could resemble dissected arteries and organs:
the topography of a peculiar creature rendered for study.
The lines surveying a foreign anatomy of township,
like a confounding specimen: illegible, though exposed.

As these words are written, the page of this map
could be attended by a dragonfly marked red and blue:
nameless to itself, born of connate ponds and fields.
The clear panes and regions of its wings bordered in black.

Like roads on a map, each arterial line housing a lens, now held
over the routes and destinations in red, blue, green, and black.
The projected lines, the compass rose now legible, the bearing
clear, as if foreseen, the way forward open and understood.
