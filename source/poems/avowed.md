**Avowed**

"...of course, I disavow and condemn them."



I will become milk, and in a bowl will mix myself 

with ash to make a healing poultice

for conscience or memory.



I will remove my rested heart and place it 

on the road shoulder, to aid a traveler 

in need of repair.



I will walk before the stores and churches 

and open my wallet and let the birds 

fly out to roost wherever they see fit.



I will pray we each may shoulder a humbling burden 

one we hold around us as a sign 

of no harm intended.



I will stand with the cornflowers and sawgrass 

in the field, and wave at the glowering

aircraft as they pass above.



I will fill the cracks in every rotting foundation

with my fingers, and intend to do so 

until the rain stops.



I will weave a flag of creepers and fallen leaves, 

starred with shining insects, and fly it unseen 

in a forest of disputed territory.



I will learn to speak every language but this one 

and will change the color of my tongue

for each in turn.
