**Bill Evans is Arrested for Heroin Possession at JFK**



"... I have always preferred playing without an audience.” - Bill Evans



Standing beside the shining baggage claim 

the pianist wishes for evaporation, as opposed

to flight, since he has just come to ground. 

The carousel is empty, still, yet humming in key: 

planes of stainless linked in sequence, an endless scale.

Waiting for the valise holding his fix to reach his hand 

the marshals are static outside the automatic doors 

in sunlight and heat. This is for them a minor affair.

It is early in the decade, but late for absolution. 

He has tried again to be honest with his lovers.

He has repaid the money to his friends.

The carpet looks so cool, so broad and smooth 

he would like to reach down and feel it with his fingers.

He sees his reflection, jacketed and tied, in the glass, 

and the half-note difference between black and white 

forms a space in his mind where he rests for a count.

Then, the switch is turned on and the carousel keys slide. 

Somewhere inside a beat begins, and so he must play.



**30th Street Studios, 3/2/59**



This is not some tuxedo gig in the Village

and the stand is wide but not quite level.

Maybe a change, I say. A little slower,

gentler maybe? Miles, in blue light 

waves the horn in his hand at me.

“We don’t need no whitey opinions

Moe. You so damn square,” they laugh. 

But I’m tight. I’m the irony in every set. 

My head bent right-angle I never see 

my fingers arch over the thin space 

between each key. I start with a phrase

of chords, work inside the mode 

and ease down, add soft pedal, eating 

crow to Jimmy’s brushes, while Miles 

holds his mute so we each get our say.



**Why Bill Evans Got Addicted to Junk**



It wasn't about living down Plainfield, N.J.

and all that square noise with his daddy.



It wasn't to be down with the colored musicians,

or that nonsense about how it give a player touch.



Philly Joe Jones was not the Prince of Darkness

and Bill was not out there playing Faust.



Bill Evans got addicted to junk

for none of these reasons.



Bill Evans got addicted to junk

because junk is delightful.



It is post-bop, it is modal.

It is delightful. 



**Bill Evans Solos Alone**



“What Kind of Fool Am I?”



The changes are temporal

but he experiences them as space,

as wall meets wall

as the chord resolves

enclosing him in this room

with the instrument.



Here he presses toward a stillness

he cannot achieve,

fails always to answer

the instrument's question.



**After the Death of Scott LaFaro**



Past midnight the Dodge rolled over 

and left the curved pavement 

of Route 20 near Flint 

in the Finger Lakes. 

The old sweet double bass 

in the back seat was mostly crushed 

but not damaged by the fire.



Back in the city there was a low long 

time off through the autumn: 

a numb space in which loss 

could improvise, 

but then the piano 

slid over again into the first bars 

of that Gershwin tune, as if on its own. 



**Waltz for Debby (Alternate Take)**



If I could keep the room sweet,

could keep you from the weary

work of being grown, keep 



the window lit somehow 

with sun, sin somewhere 

else and silent. Secure there 



then you could hear just 

the music I would play to set 

you to a tender dance. Amid



an audience of dolls, I would

render you permanent, unaware 

that the gold in the air is nothing 



but dust hanging in late light 

and the soft floor you spin on 

nothing but a clown's closing palm.
