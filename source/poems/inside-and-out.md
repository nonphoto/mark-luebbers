**Inside and Out**



Even with clouds slipping over us 

from the west and the old snow 

waiting to be interred beneath 

its new kith. 

Even with the cold so dry our hands 

crack like pottery.

Even with the drudge chores 

of the house waiting to be taken 

in hand again. 

Even while the trees outside creak 

in the cold, and stones near the creek 

sit frozen dry, while small creatures 

interred beneath them are curled so tight 

they sleep like stones. 

Even with the water in the soil frozen

into thin stems that push up bits of earth 

like fists of grey flowers.

Notice that each afternoon the light

stays a minute more. 

Notice the baroque frost reaching out 

across the window like some painterâ€™s 

mad testament. 

Notice the small lamp staying on

in the corner of the warm room

waiting for you to come sit close by.
