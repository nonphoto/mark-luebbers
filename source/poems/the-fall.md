title: The Fall
preformatted: true

By the time we are able
to know their green past
They are hard-edged and drained
of suppleness, semblances only
of once high rare residents,
Now they cling to the hard
sources of their days.
Swaying in the risky air,
their landscape becomes strange.
Season and light shifting away,
we wait hopefully with them
for some final bright gestures,
but pray at least,
Since they are after all, our parents,
That we are present to bear witness.
That they not descend unseen,
or in darkness, at our passing feet
