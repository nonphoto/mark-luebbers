    <h3>Piano Fire</h3>
    <p>
      In a cowflop field up the Trebo road,<br>
      Old Gassett has a hundred or more, piled and scattered.<br>
      Uprights mostly, players, a few busted baby grands,<br>
      a battle plain of the excoriated, decorated old soldiers<br>
      culled from barns, emptied from parlors,<br>
      unsold from estate sales, left-behinds from foreclosures<br>
      or auctioned off clans grown and moved.<br>
      They are long-toothed, exhausted veterans<br>
      of kids&rsquo; scales, booze breath sing-alongs,<br>
      carols for the deaf grandmother, and the waltz,<br>
      the rag, the boogie-woogie, Broadway<br>
      and the tuneless wanderings of sleepless<br>
      fingers in the dark.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is senseless work, making this collection.<br>
      Gassett yanks and swears, levering them<br>
      onto the dolly up the ramp to the trailer <br>
      for the ride behind the pickup up the hill. <br>
      Camp now to mice and wrens,<br>
      once prized ebony lacquers now mottled. <br>
      Standing with splintered, warped tops like<br>
      wrecked tuxedo socialites, tilted and reeling,<br>
      wearing sprung collars and spattered<br>
      with insults from pigeons and bats.<br>
      Gap toothed smiles leer from curved keyboards<br>
      held in skeletal frames.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Gassett says he&rsquo;ll invite everyone he knows up to see<br>
      when he decides its time. Grill and swill.<br>
      Haul &rsquo;em all to the middle, huck in a gallon of kerosene.<br>
      And chuck on the smoking end of a Swisher Sweet.<br>
      We&rsquo;ll stand clear of the crashed chords,<br>
      singing strings, moans of failing joinery,<br>
      skyward flailing sparks and the chorus of perfect ash,<br>
      And howl with joy at all noise, light, and upward endings.<br>

    <h3>Flashlight</h3>
    <p>
      &rsquo;68 bike ride home from supper at Davey&rsquo;s house.<br>
      It&rsquo;s Friday night: hot dogs, Spaghetti-O&rsquo;s and Chips Ahoy.<br>
      In the front wheel of my Stingray, a clothespin holds a ball card.<br>
      The fading yellow beam of a big chrome watchman&rsquo;s friend, <br>
      Wobbles duck taped to the chopper bars.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the driveway and the D cells quit.<br>
      No high beams oncoming. No streetlights to race under.<br>
      No possum eyes or porch lamps, I&rsquo;m piloting just by crickets,<br>
      thrush song, tire buzz and infinite happy blindness. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Which, as I lift my hands free as wings, slips into foresight:<br>
      Mom and Dad will die someday, then me, then my sisters.<br>
      All will roll away into murk and vacuum.<br>
      No birdsongs, stars, Laugh-in, no Hot Wheels.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      There is only now, and the sudden ache<br>
      for the lamp light over my desk,<br>
      after the climb up the long hill to our garage,<br>
      So steep I have to get off and walk every time.<br>

      &ldquo;Like the subjects of these poems, I&rsquo;ve lived most of my life on the border between the natural and &lsquo;manufactured&rsquo; worlds, as I suppose many people do today, and find it a confusing, frustrating and fascinating way to live.&rdquo;
