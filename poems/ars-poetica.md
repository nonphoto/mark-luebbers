Seared under smeared sun
July hulking in plastic pot
green-black dusk watered
by crashing gutter washers
the tomato plant manages
to stand hunched on fibrous
stalk holding out spotted leaves
as if in meek plea but bearing
still some few fruit round
of a shining yellow.

Each day one or two small fists
of promise that mostly vanish
overnight plucked by raccoons
who leave black mocking footprint
trail across deck boards or dropped
by the wind to concrete below.

So this one that I manage
to pull from hard stem
and hold small and palm
warm sour and tough
though it will surely be
is the prize beyond
any keeping past now.
