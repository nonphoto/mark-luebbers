                    <div class="poem-content"><p>Plain corrugation of clouds:
amber, midwest, underlit,
proceeding stately above
the empty con-tower. Dark
panes like sunglasses looking
down on runic lines of tar
written into cracked tarmac.
Warthogs and Hueys dismissed
from the apron: cut up, mothballed,
or sold to convenient friends.
Trucks parked in the last standing
hangar and beset with sparrows.</p>

<p>Behind new chain-link, jacks
and backhoes have pulled
down the terminal into shoals
of cinderblock and linoleum,
sprouting rebar. The remnants
beholden to rising goldenrod,
sawgrass, and the province
of blackbird and red fox.</p>

<p>Wind folds around standing
antennae, through spaces between
so many tools of an old trade,
while calm radiates with the day’s
heat. That which accompanies
obsolescence, with a state
of waiting: to be removed,
to be resolved according
to current affairs, our fears
having shifted to a new
imminence, and our
new responses employed.</p></div>

                    <div class="poem-content"><p>She is a pointed Artemis, surveying and holding
over the dusk median of I-70 in suspension, patience.
The taillights trailing away blood lit.
Her flight framed in the pulse and stream of traffic.
Hovering, her splayed primaries caught in rushing high beams.
Flagging me off from her province, miles long and scant feet wide.
She is hunting in the margin between come and gone.</p>

<p>While she is poised beside the diluted moon in my side window,
I hope for her the narrowest of blessings: a sustaining prize
In the steppe of state-mown ryegrass.
Her quarry sheltering in tires, cups, boxes sagging,
Stained shirt or shoe: the interstate mouse, the pecking starling,
Red-eyed cicada or dusty shrew. May she take them with reflex
and expert eye, wary of fast disaster close on either side.</p></div>

                    <div class="poem-content"><p>In the preened cul-de-sac, one house built before the rest
keeps a rural semblance. Some paint peels. A swaying small
barn is attached. A bare oak hails from a medium of ripe weeds.</p>

<p>Junes, a cashbox and table stood in the grass streetside,
presenting, undeclared, several jars of candescent honey.
Over the days they disappeared. Some stolen. Some sold.</p>

<p>By July this year there is no table. Instead by the curb
a cardboard square: Sorry Dead Hives. The civil habits
of the vehicles and houses proceed in busy disregard.</p>

<p>What is the margin between communion and collapse?
Our residence is a tight bargain. Inside the frame of
pale walls, there is some manna, and some latent blight.</p>

<p>Every host builds its dependent cells, which,
untended, may bring latent blights to flower.</p></div>

                    <div class="poem-content"><p>Seared under smeared sun
July hulking in plastic pot
green-black dusk watered
by crashing gutter washers
the tomato plant manages
to stand hunched on fibrous
stalk holding out spotted leaves
as if in meek plea but bearing
still some few fruit round
of a shining yellow.</p>

<p>Each day one or two small fists
of promise that mostly vanish
overnight plucked by raccoons
who leave black mocking footprint
trail across deck boards or dropped
by the wind to concrete below.</p>

<p>So this one that I manage
to pull from hard stem
and hold small and palm
warm sour and tough
though it will surely be
is the prize beyond
any keeping past now.</p></div>

                    <div class="poem-content"><p>The posts set straight once, stayed upright long enough
to outlast the cows, now straying from vertical and splintered gray.</p>

<p>The course along the pasture grown over in chokecherry and gorse.
Wires red-brown and soft with rust, but still up, mostly.</p>

<p>Pointed coils spaced one foot each along three lines in rhythm
and wavering pitch. No longer keeping anyone out of anywhere,
just keeping time.</p>

<p>All that past effort for tidy division splayed and breached. Every measure
between posts has since caught some evidence of weather or passage:
milkweed husk, knots of grass, feather, clotted hair of deer and coydog.
Odd notes, hung on the staff of a score composed slowly by season,
played by crickets.</p></div>

                    <div class="poem-content"><p>The roads in these farm lands run along the rules of vector
and radius. Reaching small towns, they become brittle
and hollow streets, which bisect mostly hard standing structures,
emptied, made of brick or wood, containing occasional persons.</p>

<p>Between each road and town, the green areas are conscribed
and managed, more or less according to practices of profit, chemistry,
and using appendaged machines. Fields rest, divided by standing
or leaning fences, and walls of stones, upright or stumbling along.</p>

<p>Property is purpose in this landscape. Docile animals, populating
low barns, or standing in squared spaces, sway in the weather.
Wheeled machinery, red or green, for inscribing, medicating,
and culling from the swaying earth, churns and labors, or idles.</p>

<p>Land of collection: the standing or swaying animals, vehicles in care
or decay, wheeled toys upturned, fading in the weather, appliances
agape, furniture from a near or distant room, presented on the land,
presided over by insects from the fields, and guarded by harping birds.</p>

<p>Arranged around small metal houses, or old wooden houses, outside doors
and windows: all these possessions, settling down and into the used earth
each particle with each rain, as though it all might soon be subsumed,
determined for a particular moment to germinate, and grow new.</p></div>

                    <div class="poem-content"><p>These words could be written in the border margin
of a map rendering the assembled counties of Ohio.
The page in the bare sun presented to the reader’s eye
on the side of a county road wavering in the green heat.</p>

<p>The road ahead meandering and inscrutable, nameless,
as all roads to themselves are, bisecting farms and woodlots:
homes of creatures domestic and feral. The reader perhaps a
pilgrim, expatriate or lost, and as such, in hope of bearing.</p>

<p>This map could resemble dissected arteries and organs:
the topography of a peculiar creature rendered for study.
The lines surveying a foreign anatomy of township,
like a confounding specimen: illegible, though exposed.</p>

<p>As these words are written, the page of this map
could be attended by a dragonfly marked red and blue:
nameless to itself, born of connate ponds and fields.
The clear panes and regions of its wings bordered in black.</p>

<p>Like roads on a map, each arterial line housing a lens, now held
over the routes and destinations in red, blue, green, and black.
The projected lines, the compass rose now legible, the bearing
clear, as if foreseen, the way forward open and understood.</p></div>

                    <div class="poem-content"><p>’68 bike ride home from supper at Davey’s house.
It’s Friday night: hot dogs, Spaghetti-O’s and Chips Ahoy.
In the front wheel of my Stingray, a clothespin holds a ball card.
The fading yellow beam of a big chrome watchman’s friend,
Wobbles duck taped to the chopper bars.</p>

<p>Down the driveway and the D cells quit.
No high beams oncoming. No streetlights to race under.
No possum eyes or porch lamps, I’m piloting just by crickets,
thrush song, tire buzz and infinite happy blindness.</p>

<p>Which, as I lift my hands free as wings, slips into foresight:
Mom and Dad will die someday, then me, then my sisters.
All will roll away into murk and vacuum.
No birdsongs, stars, Laugh-in, no Hot Wheels.</p>

<p>There is only now, and the sudden ache
for the lamp light over my desk,
after the climb up the long hill to our garage,
So steep I have to get off and walk every time.</p></div>

                    <div class="poem-content"><p>The six-point buck
stands fastened
in the driveway
in full morning
summer light
candid in place
no reticence
tension recessed
effortless
in the pull
of his senses
drawn evenly
from the hollow
cover of brush,
to lilies
and cosmos
bedded and ripe
all the frantic birds
in early commerce
homeowners marching
down the plain sidewalk
towed by dogs
the outbound flight
close growling overhead
and a dreadnought
passing train
beyond the trees
while in herds
traffic bellows
toward the city.</p></div>

                    <h3 class="poem-title sticky-element">Iris Tree Chooses a Role, 1913</h3>
                    <div class="poem-content"><p>W.S. Gilbert was a fixture at Father’s table, where he made, some whispered, advances to Mother that were as cleverly expressed as they were improper in design. Ellen Terry presided at the Christmas theatricals Father produced for the children each winter, her beauty refined and enlarged in old age. And Father was knighted in 1909 during the run of Twelfth Night at His Majesty’s. Playing Malvolio, he spoke of how greatness comes, and the people rose and silenced him with their applause.</p>

<p>The question for a child growing up in these theaters was, always and emphatically, whom to be, and young Iris addressed herself to this question with deep misgivings, as it seemed that all of the roles had been previously assigned. So, at age 16, in a second-class coach from Wolverhampton, Iris cut off nine inches of her hair (her luminous, red-gold, Pre-Raphaelite hair) and left it, a strange bouquet, on her seat when she emerged at Paddington Station.</p></div>

                    <div class="poem-content"><p>That was the summer at Bognor, back in the dunes, when Iris at nineteen held in Nancy Manners’ Kirby Grips a tiny smoldering ember of hashish wrapped in a strip of The Telegraph, (Father called it The Tory-graph) inhaled deeply and waited, as Nancy vomited on the sand, for what would come. Some aspirant boy had bought it for them from an Algerian at the docks, and Iris was expecting arabesques, but what came, along with the sense that her peripheral vision had contracted, was a series of aperçus. First, that unlike sexual experience, which was a wanting that could result in a having, aesthetic experience was a wanting of what never could be had. Also, that the odds against living the dreary conventional life of her time, place, and class were so laughably, implausibly bad, that her own escape must be treasured—consciously, actively, treasured—for the singularity it was. Further, that time was inescapably subjective, that growing up was a growing away, and that her hair was certainly her best feature. These and a good lot of rubbish that only made sense at the time.</p></div>

                    <div class="poem-content"><p>The coyotes nightly move in twos
and threes across the black backyards
and along the fences in the townships
of Ohio, within earshot of the beltway.
Picaroons, ragged and dauntless, robbing
dinner bones from the trash, pillaging
the odd suburban chicken or the family
cat, and pausing under the streetlight.</p>

<p>Whereupon, seen from say, the kitchen
window by a woman in the grip of night
clothes and insomnia, the police are hailed,
the media are primed, and by morning
the public is duly warned: Lock the heirlooms
and flowers! Back up your files! Buy bread
and gasoline! Are your vaccines up to date?
Stay tuned for more fascinating dangers!</p>

<p>But we need these transient crimes, alien
as they are from human code. We may augur
terror from the scat on our lawns, yet is it
not right and true to have a few interlopers
shambling among us, while we are retracted
and reposed? They take their tariff, hold
morsels of our security in their teeth, hold
the dark open, and lightly prance away.</p></div>

                    <div class="poem-content"><p>Dust giant in the field behind the superstore, rising
in the late sun over offices in the strained wind, built
from worn air. The ambitious heat rises, spins
and strides away, across the access roads,
away from a tangle of derelict shopping carts.</p>

<p>Chrome baskets piled into an architecture
of rusting discard. Wheeled feet splayed
up in the dry weeds. The latticed tenement
of voles and crickets, of perched starlings,
impatient crows and spiders squatting.</p>

<p>A cross-hatched catch fence for coupon flyers,
flayed cardboard, erratic plastic bottles.
Chaff and leaves collect at the feet of small flowers.
Wind, in discordant song, plays in the geometry
of bent steel wire and small creatures.</p>

<p>Dusk wanders slowly into the space left by the wind.
Lights from cars and parking lot reflect from the junk,
onto shy hares, possums sidling through hairy grasses.
A jaded, tattered fox passes in evening transit.
All these residents in the business of procurement.</p>

<p>Gleaning for themselves, across the bound,
meager landscape. Enough, or nearly so.</p></div>

rising under the standing lights in an empty parking lot.
Behind the box store, she is innocuous, disguised as a shred
of retread, a cable, or lost tie down.
In a landscape of gray scale and litter, in a grid-laid
plain for waiting, she is the purpose-built anomaly:
reflecting darkness, curving in stasis, antithesis of tar.</p></div>

                    <div class="poem-content"><p>In a cowflop field up the Trebo road,
Old Gassett has a hundred or more, piled and scattered.
Uprights mostly, players, a few busted baby grands,
a battle plain of the excoriated, decorated old soldiers
culled from barns, emptied from parlors,
unsold from estate sales, left-behinds from foreclosures
or auctioned off clans grown and moved.
They are long-toothed, exhausted veterans
of kids’ scales, booze breath sing-alongs,
carols for the deaf grandmother, and the waltz,
the rag, the boogie-woogie, Broadway
and the tuneless wanderings of sleepless
fingers in the dark.</p>

<p>It is senseless work, making this collection.
Gassett yanks and swears, levering them
onto the dolly up the ramp to the trailer
for the ride behind the pickup up the hill.
Camp now to mice and wrens,
once prized ebony lacquers now mottled.
Standing with splintered, warped tops like
wrecked tuxedo socialites, tilted and reeling,
wearing sprung collars and spattered
with insults from pigeons and bats.
Gap toothed smiles leer from curved keyboards
held in skeletal frames.</p>

<p>Gassett says he’ll invite everyone he knows up to see
when he decides its time. Grill and swill.
Haul ’em all to the middle, huck in a gallon of kerosene.
And chuck on the smoking end of a Swisher Sweet.
We’ll stand clear of the crashed chords,
singing strings, moans of failing joinery,
skyward flailing sparks and the chorus of perfect ash,
And howl with joy at all noise, light, and upward endings.</p></div>

just west of the Goethals bridge, crossing
the river into New Jersey, November, 1967.
The sun is meek and low, so the windshield
glare is slight, but enough to wash the tanks
of the Philips refinery faintly blue. He sits
on the vinyl of a Plymouth, which sits on an arc
of concrete. He turns off the radio. The other
interchanges curve into knots across and above
the scarred marsh, each causeway posted
over the mud on staunch legs. Crawling yellow
machines below slog along a temporary road
lugging loads of sand and stones to the site
of a new ramp. Under their tracks, the earth
is gracefully rising, then ending like a question
about the difference between a monument
and a ruin. He waits in an interruption, among
cars, trucks, the blue exhaust gracefully rising,
gasoline and afternoon slowly burning away.</p></div>

to know their green past
They are hard-edged and drained
of suppleness, semblances only
of once high rare residents,
Now they cling to the hard
sources of their days.
Swaying in the risky air,
their landscape becomes strange.
Season and light shifting away,
we wait hopefully with them
for some final bright gestures,
but pray at least,
Since they are after all, our parents,
That we are present to bear witness.
That they not descend unseen,
or in darkness, at our passing feet</p></div>

<p>Striated, creased,
scarified and peppered,
along your hardened skin.
Knotted at every joint.
Stiff bent body
held pointed
on tibiae like splinters
Standing stuck along
a wall near to home
in some sumacs and ashes.
Ancient in form
and purpose,
built now only to play
the part of a dry
appendage
atrophied past use,
cast down by means
of recent storm.
Swaying in place
as if to an aura,
as if from a palsy,
as if demented, or
as if to focus
your weak eyes
on a welcome shadow.
Near to a ghost
in your single season,
and scarcely there
even in the open.
About to step off
toward some
solace hidden
out of the sun
or stooping wings.
Each movement
articulated
rickety
as if mocking
an old dance.</p></div>

            <h3>About the Author</h3>
            <p>
                Mark Luebbers teaches English at an independent school outside of Cincinnati, Ohio. He has written poetry sporadically all his life but has become serious about the discipline and more ambitious about publication in&nbsp;recent&nbsp;years.

                “Like the subjects of these poems, I’ve lived most of my life on the border between the natural and ‘manufactured’ worlds, as I suppose many people do today, and find it a confusing, frustrating and fascinating way to live.”
