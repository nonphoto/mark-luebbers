In the preened cul-de-sac, one house built before the rest
keeps a rural semblance. Some paint peels. A swaying small
barn is attached. A bare oak hails from a medium of ripe weeds.

Junes, a cashbox and table stood in the grass streetside,
presenting, undeclared, several jars of candescent honey.
Over the days they disappeared. Some stolen. Some sold.

By July this year there is no table. Instead by the curb
a cardboard square: Sorry Dead Hives. The civil habits
of the vehicles and houses proceed in busy disregard.

What is the margin between communion and collapse?
Our residence is a tight bargain. Inside the frame of
pale walls, there is some manna, and some latent blight.

Every host builds its dependent cells, which,
untended, may bring latent blights to flower.
