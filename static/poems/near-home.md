Dust giant in the field behind the superstore, rising
in the late sun over offices in the strained wind, built
from worn air. The ambitious heat rises, spins
and strides away, across the access roads,
away from a tangle of derelict shopping carts.

Chrome baskets piled into an architecture
of rusting discard. Wheeled feet splayed
up in the dry weeds. The latticed tenement
of voles and crickets, of perched starlings,
impatient crows and spiders squatting.

A cross-hatched catch fence for coupon flyers,
flayed cardboard, erratic plastic bottles.
Chaff and leaves collect at the feet of small flowers.
Wind, in discordant song, plays in the geometry
of bent steel wire and small creatures.

Dusk wanders slowly into the space left by the wind.
Lights from cars and parking lot reflect from the junk,
onto shy hares, possums sidling through hairy grasses.
A jaded, tattered fox passes in evening transit.
All these residents in the business of procurement.

Gleaning for themselves, across the bound,
meager landscape. Enough, or nearly so.
