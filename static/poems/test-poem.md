Having moved with her family to Kansas
from Wisconsin woods, by way of
Missouri, but before her father's lease
on the new farm was revoked for lying
on the Osage Diminished Reserve
in her early girlhood, she waded
through the bluestem grass, trying
both to sway, and to stay upright.

Behind the gray-brown house, she found
nests of fleeing mice, who ignored
her apologies and appeals to come back.
Quail too, launched from their hatchlings,
leaving them to scatter under the thatch
and in her chest, she could feel
the percussion of wings.

And once, ferrets—which she scared off
with her careless steps, and they were like
threads of a dream: traceless, slippery
in the dim light under the grass
and almost gone before one knew
they were ever there.

_Everything leaves_, she thought:
grasshopper, milkweed seed, V of geese
—pushed by wind, cold, hunger
or a shadow beyond
reckoning.
