The posts set straight once, stayed upright long enough
to outlast the cows, now straying from vertical and splintered gray.

The course along the pasture grown over in chokecherry and gorse.
Wires red-brown and soft with rust, but still up, mostly.

Pointed coils spaced one foot each along three lines in rhythm
and wavering pitch. No longer keeping anyone out of anywhere,
just keeping time.

All that past effort for tidy division splayed and breached. Every measure
between posts has since caught some evidence of weather or passage:
milkweed husk, knots of grass, feather, clotted hair of deer and coydog.
Odd notes, hung on the staff of a score composed slowly by season,
played by crickets.
