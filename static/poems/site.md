Robert Smithson is stuck in traffic on 278
just west of the Goethals bridge, crossing
the river into New Jersey, November, 1967.
The sun is meek and low, so the windshield
glare is slight, but enough to wash the tanks
of the Philips refinery faintly blue. He sits
on the vinyl of a Plymouth, which sits on an arc
of concrete. He turns off the radio. The other
interchanges curve into knots across and above
the scarred marsh, each causeway posted
over the mud on staunch legs. Crawling yellow
machines below slog along a temporary road
lugging loads of sand and stones to the site
of a new ramp. Under their tracks, the earth
is gracefully rising, then ending like a question
about the difference between a monument
and a ruin. He waits in an interruption, among
cars, trucks, the blue exhaust gracefully rising,
gasoline and afternoon slowly burning away.
