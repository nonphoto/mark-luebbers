    Robert Smithson is stuck in traffic on 278<br/>
    just west of the Goethals bridge, crossing<br/>
    the river into New Jersey, November, 1967.<br/>
    The sun is meek and low, so the windshield<br/>
    glare is slight, but enough to wash the tanks<br/>
    of the Philips refinery faintly blue. He sits<br/>
    on the vinyl of a Plymouth, which sits on an arc<br/>
    of concrete. He turns off the radio. The other<br/>
    interchanges curve into knots across and above<br/>
    the scarred marsh, each causeway posted<br/>
    over the mud on staunch legs. Crawling yellow<br/>
    machines below slog along a temporary road<br/>
    lugging loads of sand and stones to the site<br/>
    of a new ramp. Under their tracks, the earth<br/>
    is gracefully rising, then ending like a question<br/>
    about the difference between a monument<br/>
    and a ruin. He waits in an interruption, among<br/>
    cars, trucks, the blue exhaust gracefully rising,<br/>
    gasoline and afternoon slowly burning away.<br/>
