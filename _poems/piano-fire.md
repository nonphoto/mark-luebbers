In a cowflop field up the Trebo road,
Old Gassett has a hundred or more, piled and scattered.
Uprights mostly, players, a few busted baby grands,
a battle plain of the excoriated, decorated old soldiers
culled from barns, emptied from parlors,
unsold from estate sales, left-behinds from foreclosures
or auctioned off clans grown and moved.
They are long-toothed, exhausted veterans
of kids&rsquo; scales, booze breath sing-alongs,
carols for the deaf grandmother, and the waltz,
the rag, the boogie-woogie, Broadway
and the tuneless wanderings of sleepless
fingers in the dark.

It is senseless work, making this collection.
Gassett yanks and swears, levering them
onto the dolly up the ramp to the trailer
for the ride behind the pickup up the hill.
Camp now to mice and wrens,
once prized ebony lacquers now mottled.
Standing with splintered, warped tops like
wrecked tuxedo socialites, tilted and reeling,
wearing sprung collars and spattered
with insults from pigeons and bats.
Gap toothed smiles leer from curved keyboards
held in skeletal frames.

Gassett says he&rsquo;ll invite everyone he knows up to see
when he decides its time. Grill and swill.
Haul &rsquo;em all to the middle, huck in a gallon of kerosene.
And chuck on the smoking end of a Swisher Sweet.
We&rsquo;ll stand clear of the crashed chords,
singing strings, moans of failing joinery,
skyward flailing sparks and the chorus of perfect ash,
And howl with joy at all noise, light, and upward endings.
