<p>
  Dust giant in the field behind the superstore, rising<br/>
  in the late sun over offices in the strained wind, built<br/>
  from worn air. The ambitious heat rises, spins<br/>
  and strides away, across the access roads,<br/>
  away from a tangle of derelict shopping carts.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  Chrome baskets piled into an architecture<br/>
  of rusting discard. Wheeled feet splayed<br/>
  up in the dry weeds. The latticed tenement<br/>
  of voles and crickets, of perched starlings,<br/>
  impatient crows and spiders squatting.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  A cross-hatched catch fence for coupon flyers,<br/>
  flayed cardboard, erratic plastic bottles.<br/>
  Chaff and leaves collect at the feet of small flowers.<br/>
  Wind, in discordant song, plays in the geometry<br/>
  of bent steel wire and small creatures.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  Dusk wanders slowly into the space left by the wind.<br/>
  Lights from cars and parking lot reflect from the junk,<br/>
  onto shy hares, possums sidling through hairy grasses.<br/>
  A jaded, tattered fox passes in evening transit.<br/>
  All these residents in the business of procurement.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  Gleaning for themselves, across the bound,<br/>
  meager landscape. Enough, or nearly so.<br/>
