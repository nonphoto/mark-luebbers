  The coyotes nightly move in twos<br/>
  and threes across the black backyards<br/>
  and along the fences in the townships<br/>
  of Ohio, within earshot of the beltway.<br/>
  Picaroons, ragged and dauntless, robbing<br/>
  dinner bones from the trash, pillaging<br/>
  the odd suburban chicken or the family<br/>
  cat, and pausing under the streetlight.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  Whereupon, seen from say, the kitchen<br/>
  window by a woman in the grip of night<br/>
  clothes and insomnia, the police are hailed,<br/>
  the media are primed, and by morning<br/>
  the public is duly warned: Lock the heirlooms<br/>
  and flowers! Back up your files! Buy bread<br/>
  and gasoline! Are your vaccines up to date?<br/>
  Stay tuned for more fascinating dangers!<br/>
</p>
<p>
  But we need these transient crimes, alien<br/>
  as they are from human code. We may augur<br/>
  terror from the scat on our lawns, yet is it<br/>
  not right and true to have a few interlopers<br/>
  shambling among us, while we are retracted<br/>
  and reposed? They take their tariff, hold<br/>
  morsels of our security in their teeth, hold<br/>
  the dark open, and lightly prance away.<br/>
