<p>
  These words could be written in the border margin<br/>
  of a map rendering the assembled counties of Ohio.<br/>
  The page in the bare sun presented to the readerâ€™s eye<br/>
  on the side of a county road wavering in the green heat.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  The road ahead meandering and inscrutable, nameless,<br/>
  as all roads to themselves are, bisecting farms and woodlots:<br/>
  homes of creatures domestic and feral. The reader perhaps a<br/>
  pilgrim, expatriate or lost, and as such, in hope of bearing.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  This map could resemble dissected arteries and organs:<br/>
  the topography of a peculiar creature rendered for study.<br/>
  The lines surveying a foreign anatomy of township,<br/>
  like a confounding specimen: illegible, though exposed.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  As these words are written, the page of this map<br/>
  could be attended by a dragonfly marked red and blue:<br/>
  nameless to itself, born of connate ponds and fields.<br/>
  The clear panes and regions of its wings bordered in black.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  Like roads on a map, each arterial line housing a lens, now held<br/>
  over the routes and destinations in red, blue, green, and black.<br/>
  The projected lines, the compass rose now legible, the bearing<br/>
  clear, as if foreseen, the way forward open and understood.<br/>
