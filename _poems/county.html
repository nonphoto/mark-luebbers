<p>
  The roads in these farm lands run along the rules of vector<br/>
  and radius. Reaching small towns, they become brittle<br/>
  and hollow streets, which bisect mostly hard standing structures,<br/>
  emptied, made of brick or wood, containing occasional persons.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  Between each road and town, the green areas are conscribed<br/>
  and managed, more or less according to practices of profit, chemistry,<br/>
  and using appendaged machines. Fields rest, divided by standing<br/>
  or leaning fences, and walls of stones, upright or stumbling along.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  Property is purpose in this landscape. Docile animals, populating<br/>
  low barns, or standing in squared spaces, sway in the weather.<br/>
  Wheeled machinery, red or green, for inscribing, medicating,<br/>
  and culling from the swaying earth, churns and labors, or idles.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  Land of collection: the standing or swaying animals, vehicles in care<br/>
  or decay, wheeled toys upturned, fading in the weather, appliances<br/>
  agape, furniture from a near or distant room, presented on the land,<br/>
  presided over by insects from the fields, and guarded by harping birds.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  Arranged around small metal houses, or old wooden houses, outside doors<br/>
  and windows: all these possessions, settling down and into the used earth<br/>
  each particle with each rain, as though it all might soon be subsumed,<br/>
  determined for a particular moment to germinate, and grow new.<br/>
