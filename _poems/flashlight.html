<p>
  &rsquo;68 bike ride home from supper at Davey&rsquo;s house.<br>
  It&rsquo;s Friday night: hot dogs, Spaghetti-O&rsquo;s and Chips Ahoy.<br>
  In the front wheel of my Stingray, a clothespin holds a ball card.<br>
  The fading yellow beam of a big chrome watchman&rsquo;s friend,<br>
  Wobbles duck taped to the chopper bars.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Down the driveway and the D cells quit.<br>
  No high beams oncoming. No streetlights to race under.<br>
  No possum eyes or porch lamps, I&rsquo;m piloting just by crickets,<br>
  thrush song, tire buzz and infinite happy blindness.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Which, as I lift my hands free as wings, slips into foresight:<br>
  Mom and Dad will die someday, then me, then my sisters.<br>
  All will roll away into murk and vacuum.<br>
  No birdsongs, stars, Laugh-in, no Hot Wheels.<br>
</p>
<p>
  There is only now, and the sudden ache<br>
  for the lamp light over my desk,<br>
  after the climb up the long hill to our garage,<br>
  So steep I have to get off and walk every time.<br>
