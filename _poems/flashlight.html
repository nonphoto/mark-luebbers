&rsquo;68 bike ride home from supper at Davey&rsquo;s house.
It&rsquo;s Friday night: hot dogs, Spaghetti-O&rsquo;s and Chips Ahoy.
In the front wheel of my Stingray, a clothespin holds a ball card.
The fading yellow beam of a big chrome watchman&rsquo;s friend,
Wobbles duck taped to the chopper bars.

Down the driveway and the D cells quit.
No high beams oncoming. No streetlights to race under.
No possum eyes or porch lamps, I&rsquo;m piloting just by crickets,
thrush song, tire buzz and infinite happy blindness.

Which, as I lift my hands free as wings, slips into foresight:
Mom and Dad will die someday, then me, then my sisters.
All will roll away into murk and vacuum.
No birdsongs, stars, Laugh-in, no Hot Wheels.

There is only now, and the sudden ache
for the lamp light over my desk,
after the climb up the long hill to our garage,
So steep I have to get off and walk every time.
