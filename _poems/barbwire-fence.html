    The posts set straight once, stayed upright long enough<br/>
    to outlast the cows, now straying from vertical and splintered gray.<br/>
</p>
<p>
    The course along the pasture grown over in chokecherry and gorse.<br/>
    Wires red-brown and soft with rust, but still up, mostly.<br/>
</p>
<p>
    Pointed coils spaced one foot each along three lines in rhythm<br/>
    and wavering pitch. No longer keeping anyone out of anywhere,<br/>
    just keeping time.<br/>
</p>
<p>
    All that past effort for tidy division splayed and breached. Every measure<br/>
    between posts has since caught some evidence of weather or passage:<br/>
    milkweed husk, knots of grass, feather, clotted hair of deer and coydog.<br/>
    Odd notes, hung on the staff of a score composed slowly by season,<br/>
    played by crickets.<br/>
