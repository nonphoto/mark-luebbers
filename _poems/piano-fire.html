title: Piano Fire
---

<p>
  In a cowflop field up the Trebo road,<br/>
  Old Gassett has a hundred or more, piled and scattered.<br/>
  Uprights mostly, players, a few busted baby grands,<br/>
  a battle plain of the excoriated, decorated old soldiers<br/>
  culled from barns, emptied from parlors,<br/>
  unsold from estate sales, left-behinds from foreclosures<br/>
  or auctioned off clans grown and moved.<br/>
  They are long-toothed, exhausted veterans<br/>
  of kids&rsquo; scales, booze breath sing-alongs,<br/>
  carols for the deaf grandmother, and the waltz,<br/>
  the rag, the boogie-woogie, Broadway<br/>
  and the tuneless wanderings of sleepless<br/>
  fingers in the dark.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  It is senseless work, making this collection.<br/>
  Gassett yanks and swears, levering them<br/>
  onto the dolly up the ramp to the trailer<br/>
  for the ride behind the pickup up the hill.<br/>
  Camp now to mice and wrens,<br/>
  once prized ebony lacquers now mottled.<br/>
  Standing with splintered, warped tops like<br/>
  wrecked tuxedo socialites, tilted and reeling,<br/>
  wearing sprung collars and spattered<br/>
  with insults from pigeons and bats.<br/>
  Gap toothed smiles leer from curved keyboards<br/>
  held in skeletal frames.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  Gassett says he&rsquo;ll invite everyone he knows up to see<br/>
  when he decides its time. Grill and swill.<br/>
  Haul &rsquo;em all to the middle, huck in a gallon of kerosene.<br/>
  And chuck on the smoking end of a Swisher Sweet.<br/>
  We&rsquo;ll stand clear of the crashed chords,<br/>
  singing strings, moans of failing joinery,<br/>
  skyward flailing sparks and the chorus of perfect ash,<br/>
  And howl with joy at all noise, light, and upward endings.<br/>
