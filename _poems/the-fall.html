<p>
  By the time we are able<br/>
  to know their green past<br/>
  They are hard-edged and drained<br/>
  of suppleness, semblances only<br/>
  of once high rare residents,<br/>
  Now they cling to the hard<br/>
  sources of their days.<br/>
  Swaying in the risky air,<br/>
  their landscape becomes strange.<br/>
  Season and light shifting away,<br/>
  we wait hopefully with them<br/>
  for some final bright gestures,<br/>
  but pray at least,<br/>
  Since they are after all, our parents,<br/>
  That we are present to bear witness.<br/>
  That they not descend unseen,<br/>
  or in darkness, at our passing feet<br/>
