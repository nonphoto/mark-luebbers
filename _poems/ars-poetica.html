<p>
  Seared under smeared sun<br/>
  July hulking in plastic pot<br/>
  green-black dusk watered<br/>
  by crashing gutter washers<br/>
  the tomato plant manages<br/>
  to stand hunched on fibrous<br/>
  stalk holding out spotted leaves<br/>
  as if in meek plea but bearing<br/>
  still some few fruit round<br/>
  of a shining yellow.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  Each day one or two small fists<br/>
  of promise that mostly vanish<br/>
  overnight plucked by raccoons<br/>
  who leave black mocking footprint<br/>
  trail across deck boards or dropped<br/>
  by the wind to concrete below.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  So this one that I manage<br/>
  to pull from hard stem<br/>
  and hold small and palm<br/>
  warm sour and tough<br/>
  though it will surely be<br/>
  is the prize beyond<br/>
  any keeping past now.<br/>
