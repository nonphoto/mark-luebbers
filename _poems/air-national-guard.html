<p>
  Plain corrugation of clouds:<br/>
  amber, midwest, underlit,<br/>
  proceeding stately above<br/>
  the empty con-tower. Dark<br/>
  panes like sunglasses looking<br/>
  down on runic lines of tar<br/>
  written into cracked tarmac.<br/>
  Warthogs and Hueys dismissed<br/>
  from the apron: cut up, mothballed,<br/>
  or sold to convenient friends.<br/>
  Trucks parked in the last standing<br/>
  hangar and beset with sparrows.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  Behind new chain-link, jacks<br/>
  and backhoes have pulled<br/>
  down the terminal into shoals<br/>
  of cinderblock and linoleum,<br/>
  sprouting rebar. The remnants<br/>
  beholden to rising goldenrod,<br/>
  sawgrass, and the province<br/>
  of blackbird and red fox.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  Wind folds around standing<br/>
  antennae, through spaces between<br/>
  so many tools of an old trade,<br/>
  while calm radiates with the dayâ€™s<br/>
  heat. That which accompanies<br/>
  obsolescence, with a state<br/>
  of waiting: to be removed,<br/>
  to be resolved according<br/>
  to current affairs, our fears<br/>
  having shifted to a new<br/>
  imminence, and our<br/>
  new responses employed.<br/>
