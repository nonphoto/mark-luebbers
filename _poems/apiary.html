<p>
  In the preened cul-de-sac, one house built before the rest<br/>
  keeps a rural semblance. Some paint peels. A swaying small<br/>
  barn is attached. A bare oak hails from a medium of ripe weeds.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  Junes, a cashbox and table stood in the grass streetside,<br/>
  presenting, undeclared, several jars of candescent honey.<br/>
  Over the days they disappeared. Some stolen. Some sold.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  By July this year there is no table. Instead by the curb<br/>
  a cardboard square: Sorry Dead Hives. The civil habits<br/>
  of the vehicles and houses proceed in busy disregard.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  What is the margin between communion and collapse?<br/>
  Our residence is a tight bargain. Inside the frame of<br/>
  pale walls, there is some manna, and some latent blight.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  Every host builds its dependent cells, which,<br/>
  untended, may bring latent blights to flower.<br/>
