Black rat snake soaking in yesterdayâ€™s pavement heat
rising under the standing lights in an empty parking lot.
Behind the box store, she is innocuous, disguised as a shred
of retread, a cable, or lost tie down.
In a landscape of gray scale and litter, in a grid-laid
plain for waiting, she is the purpose-built anomaly:
reflecting darkness, curving in stasis, antithesis of tar.
