<p>
    Black rat snake soaking in yesterdayâ€™s pavement heat<br/>
    rising under the standing lights in an empty parking lot.<br/>
    Behind the box store, she is innocuous, disguised as a shred<br/>
    of retread, a cable, or lost tie down.<br/>
    In a landscape of gray scale and litter, in a grid-laid<br/>
    plain for waiting, she is the purpose-built anomaly:<br/>
    reflecting darkness, curving in stasis, antithesis of tar.<br/>
