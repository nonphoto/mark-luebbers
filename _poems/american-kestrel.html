title: American Kestrel
---

<p>
  She is a pointed Artemis, surveying and holding<br/>
  over the dusk median of I-70 in suspension, patience.<br/>
  The taillights trailing away blood lit.<br/>
  Her flight framed in the pulse and stream of traffic.<br/>
  Hovering, her splayed primaries caught in rushing high beams.<br/>
  Flagging me off from her province, miles long and scant feet wide.<br/>
  She is hunting in the margin between come and gone.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  While she is poised beside the diluted moon in my side window,<br/>
  I hope for her the narrowest of blessings: a sustaining prize<br/>
  In the steppe of state-mown ryegrass.<br/>
  Her quarry sheltering in tires, cups, boxes sagging,<br/>
  Stained shirt or shoe: the interstate mouse, the pecking starling,<br/>
  Red-eyed cicada or dusty shrew. May she take them with reflex<br/>
  and expert eye, wary of fast disaster close on either side.<br/>
