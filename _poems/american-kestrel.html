She is a pointed Artemis, surveying and holding
over the dusk median of I-70 in suspension, patience.
The taillights trailing away blood lit.
Her flight framed in the pulse and stream of traffic.
Hovering, her splayed primaries caught in rushing high beams.
Flagging me off from her province, miles long and scant feet wide.
She is hunting in the margin between come and gone.

While she is poised beside the diluted moon in my side window,
I hope for her the narrowest of blessings: a sustaining prize
In the steppe of state-mown ryegrass.
Her quarry sheltering in tires, cups, boxes sagging,
Stained shirt or shoe: the interstate mouse, the pecking starling,
Red-eyed cicada or dusty shrew. May she take them with reflex
and expert eye, wary of fast disaster close on either side.
