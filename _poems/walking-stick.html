(Diapheromera Femorata)

Striated, creased,
scarified and peppered,
along your hardened skin.
Knotted at every joint.
Stiff bent body
held pointed
on tibiae like splinters
Standing stuck along
a wall near to home
in some sumacs and ashes.
Ancient in form
and purpose,
built now only to play
the part of a dry
appendage
atrophied past use,
cast down by means
of recent storm.
Swaying in place
as if to an aura,
as if from a palsy,
as if demented, or
as if to focus
your weak eyes
on a welcome shadow.
Near to a ghost
in your single season,
and scarcely there
even in the open.
About to step off
toward some
solace hidden
out of the sun
or stooping wings.
Each movement
articulated
rickety
as if mocking
an old dance.
