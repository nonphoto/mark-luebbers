<p>
  (Diapheromera Femorata)
</p>

<p>
  Striated, creased,<br/>
  scarified and peppered,<br/>
  along your hardened skin.<br/>
  Knotted at every joint.<br/>
  Stiff bent body<br/>
  held pointed<br/>
  on tibiae like splinters<br/>
  Standing stuck along<br/>
  a wall near to home<br/>
  in some sumacs and ashes.<br/>
  Ancient in form<br/>
  and purpose,<br/>
  built now only to play<br/>
  the part of a dry<br/>
  appendage<br/>
  atrophied past use,<br/>
  cast down by means<br/>
  of recent storm.<br/>
  Swaying in place<br/>
  as if to an aura,<br/>
  as if from a palsy,<br/>
  as if demented, or<br/>
  as if to focus<br/>
  your weak eyes<br/>
  on a welcome shadow.<br/>
  Near to a ghost<br/>
  in your single season,<br/>
  and scarcely there<br/>
  even in the open.<br/>
  About to step off<br/>
  toward some<br/>
  solace hidden<br/>
  out of the sun<br/>
  or stooping wings.<br/>
  Each movement<br/>
  articulated<br/>
  rickety<br/>
  as if mocking<br/>
  an old dance.<br/>
