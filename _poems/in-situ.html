title: In Situ

The six-point buck
stands fastened
in the driveway
in full morning
summer light
candid in place
no reticence
tension recessed
effortless
in the pull
of his senses
drawn evenly
from the hollow
cover of brush,
to lilies
and cosmos
bedded and ripe
all the frantic birds
in early commerce
homeowners marching
down the plain sidewalk
towed by dogs
the outbound flight
close growling overhead
and a dreadnought
passing train
beyond the trees
while in herds
traffic bellows
toward the city.
